Welcome to my personal website. I'm a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of British Columbia, mainly working on semantics.

Broadly, my research interests are semantics, syntax-semantics interface relations, morphosyntax and field linguistics. More specifically, I am interested in the semantics of lexical aspect, event structure, and argumenthood. My dissertation focuses on what (in)transitivizing (agent) control morphology in two Salish languages - Secwepemctsín and Nłeʔkepmxcin - can tell about aspectual decomposition and event structure in natural language.

Other research interests are (i) the semantics of Dutch hoezo, (ii) the semantics and pragmatics of the at-issue behaviour of generalized culmination implicatures in some Salish languages, and (iii) morphosyntax and morphosemantics in the Germanic language family, specifically agreement (or a lack thereof), and morphological doubling.
